<p>We are regularly told that as part of our SharePoint architecture considerations we should be using SSL for end user access to SharePoint sites even for internal users. This does happen fairly frequently these days. Not always but the message does seem to be getting through. What we never see though is securing the communications between our SharePoint server and our database servers. This is a shame given how easy it is to implement and how similar the malicious user entry points are.  </p>
